# IndexerRetro

Is a small script that will index pdf files, after having been forced to do this, when realizing that the price that Adobe demands for the same service is 300$ per year. 

*To run:*

**`python indexerRetro.py --parent [Abs path to parent dir of pdf] --file [pdf name] --output [file name]`**

It will then produce a txt file which contains all of the unique words present in the pdf document, complemented by the page 
that the words appear.
